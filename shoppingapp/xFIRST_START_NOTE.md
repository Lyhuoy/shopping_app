FlutterSample is just base project so it's not containt any plateform

- kicking start you need to create any plateform that you want to develop on by run command `flutter create .`.
- `flutter create .` command will create all plateform that flutter can build so you can safe delete unwant plateform.
- run command `flutter pub get` to get all dependencies

Done!
